# Paint Nights

**Paint Night** is a relaxing, creative event where students can unwind and leave with their own painted masterpiece. It's low-pressure, low-tech, and a great way to encourage destressing ‚Äî especially toward the end of the semester.

## üß© How It Works

- We **put on a Bob Ross video** (or another easy-to-follow painting tutorial).
- We **provide paint, brushes, and canvases** for students to use.
- Everyone follows along at their own pace ‚Äî no experience needed!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

### Timing in the Semester

- We've strategically run Paint Night around **November or March**, when students are looking for ways to **unwind** and take a break from academic stress.
- You **could run this anytime** in the semester, but it's worth noting that it's achieved decent attendance in what are normally **dead zones** for event participation.

### Supply Costs

- **Art supplies can get expensive**, so buying materials in bulk or looking for deals ahead of time is a good idea.
- Consider **reusing leftover supplies** across multiple Paint Nights or similar arts-based events.

### Cleanup

- Paint can be messy. Be sure to **bring tablecloths or garbage bags** to cover tables and make cleanup easier.
- Having **paper towels, wipes, and a few garbage bins** nearby also helps keep the space tidy.
