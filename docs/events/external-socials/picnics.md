# Picnics

**Picnics** are one of our most relaxed and casual event formats ‚Äî a great way to enjoy the outdoors, hang out with friends, and build community at the start of the term.

We‚Äôve hosted picnics at two main locations:

- **Mooney‚Äôs Bay** ‚Äî A bit farther out, but historically has drawn strong attendance.
- **Vincent Massey Park** ‚Äî Used for the first time in **2024‚Äì2025**, thanks to the new walking bridge that makes it much more accessible from campus.

## üß© How It Works

- Choose a park, check the weather, and pick a date ‚Äî typically **early in the semester** when people have the bandwidth to make the commute
- Bring **blankets, snacks, drinks, and optionally lawn games**.
- Students gather, relax, and enjoy an unstructured afternoon together.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

### Timing Within the Term

- Picnics work best **early in the term**, when students are excited and looking to socialize.
- We've intentionally run them **earlier in Week of Awesome**, often on the **first Sunday**, to avoid fatigue. Hosting a picnic at the _end_ of the week risks low energy and lower turnout.

### Promotion & Clarity

- Make sure students know **how to get there**, what to bring (e.g., water, sunscreen), and what to expect.
- Encourage students to bring their own snacks or drinks if the event is casual and non-catered.

### Weather & Backup Plans

- Keep an eye on the **weather forecast** leading up to the event.
- Have a **backup plan** in case of rain or extreme weather
