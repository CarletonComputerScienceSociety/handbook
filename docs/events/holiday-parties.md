# Holiday Parties

**Holiday Parties** are themed community socials that offer students a chance to relax, celebrate, and enjoy festive snacks and activities together. Think of them as **upgraded Coffee Socials** ‚Äî with decorations, special food, and optional seasonal activities.

## üß© What They Are

Each Holiday Party could include some set of:

- **Themed food or drinks** (e.g. hot chocolate, candy canes, Halloween candy)
- **Optional activities** (e.g. pumpkin carving, crafts, games)
- **Decorations** to match the theme
- The same friendly, drop-in vibe as a Coffee Social

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

### Use Culturally Inclusive Language

Not all students celebrate the same holidays, so it's important to keep language and themes welcoming and inclusive:

- Use terms like **"Holiday Social"** or **"End-of-Term Party"** instead of "Christmas Party"
- Avoid assumptions about what students celebrate or don‚Äôt celebrate
- Opt for **seasonal themes** over religious ones (e.g. snowflakes, lights, pumpkins)
