# Sh\*t I Wish I Knew

**Sh\*t I Wish I Knew** (SIWIK) is a presentation where upper-year students share the advice, insight, and wisdom they _wish_ they had when they were first starting out at Carleton.

It is probably one of the **most important events to run in September** when new students are still figuring things out.

## üß© What It Is

- A **presentation-style event** where experienced students cover:
  - Common mistakes and how to avoid them
  - Tips for managing courses and staying on track
  - How to navigate Carleton‚Äôs systems, services, and social scene
  - Academic and personal survival advice
- Ends with a **panel discussion**, where attendees can ask questions and get multiple perspectives on student life

This event works best when speakers share **real stories**, not just generic advice ‚Äî authenticity is what makes it memorable and valuable.
