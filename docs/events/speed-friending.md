# Speed Friending

**Speed Friending** is a social event format designed to help students meet new people quickly and comfortably.

Inspired by speed dating, this event uses a custom **Discord bot** to randomly pair or group students into voice channels every few minutes ‚Äî encouraging short, engaging conversations.

This format was **extremely successful during the 2020‚Äì2021 remote year**, when students were eager for online connection. While it has seen **less traction in the return to in-person events**, it remains a fun and creative option for virtual community-building.

## üß© What It Is

- Students join a **Discord voice channel** at a scheduled time.
- A **custom bot** randomly reassigns users to different voice channels every **5 minutes**.
- Students chat in small groups or 1:1 for the duration of each round.
- After a few rounds, the event wraps up with an open chat or optional hangout space.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

### Participation Threshold

### Volunter:Participant Grouping

- It's best to try to keep one volunteer who can moderate conversation in each group
