# Online Game Sessions

**Online Game Sessions** are a fun and flexible way to connect students remotely. These events work well during breaks, off-terms, or when in-person gatherings aren’t possible.

## ⚠️ Things to Consider

### Game Accessibility

- Choose games that are **free** or very affordable so everyone can participate.
- Prioritize games that run in a **web browser** or have **low hardware requirements**.
- Avoid games with large downloads or steep learning curves unless you're targeting a more niche audience.

### Multiplayer Support

- Pick games that are **designed for group play** (ideally 4+ players).
- Avoid games that are mostly solo or have long wait times between turns.

### Consider Scheduling On Breaks

- We've found online events get better attendance during times in the year when students are not active on campus, like reading week.

### No Hosting Required

- Stick to games that offer **built-in online lobbies or matchmaking**.
- If a game requires self-hosting (e.g., a Minecraft server or custom Codenames board), ensure someone on the team knows how to handle that reliably.

### Group Size Flexibility

- Have a few game options ready in case turnout is higher or lower than expected.
- Choose games that scale well, or plan to split people into smaller lobbies if needed.
