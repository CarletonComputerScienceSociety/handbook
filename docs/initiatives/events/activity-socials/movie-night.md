# Movie Nights

**Movie Nights** are a laid-back, on-campus way to bring students together for a relaxing evening of popcorn and film. They're a great low-effort format that works well as a social or wind-down event — especially during midterms or near the end of the term.

## ⚠️ Things to Consider

Before running a Movie Night, think about:

### Content Appropriateness

Make sure the movie is **appropriate for a wide audience**. Avoid films with excessive violence, explicit content, or potentially harmful stereotypes. When in doubt, opt for something PG-13 or lower, and look up community reviews or content warnings.

### Audience Appeal

Try to pick a movie people are **excited to see** — recent blockbusters or under-the-radar hits often perform better than classics that have been seen a dozen times.

### Room & Equipment

If possible, **book a lecture hall** for better acoustics, seating, and projection. Make sure A/V equipment is tested in advance — sound or resolution issues can quickly kill the experience.
