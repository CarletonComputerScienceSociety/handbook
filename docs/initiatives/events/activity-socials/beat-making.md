# Beat Making

Beat Making Sessions are a creative event format we’ve explored to give students a chance to unwind, make music, and learn something new — no programming required.

We first hosted a session in **January 2023**, inviting students to come experiment with beat-making software in a relaxed, collaborative setting. 🔗 [View the event listing](https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2023-01-25-beat-making-session/)

## ⚠️ Things to Consider

Our first run **wasn't heavily attended** — possibly due to scheduling conflicts or poor promotion.

It is also worth noting that this format **requires** someone comfortable with beat-making software who can guide others
