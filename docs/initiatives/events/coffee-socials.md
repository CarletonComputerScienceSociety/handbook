# Coffee Socials

Coffee Socials are one of the simplest and most effective events we run — a casual gathering with free coffee, snacks, and good conversation.

## 📍 Location

If you're hoping for staff and faculty to attend, it's **crucial** to host these events **close to where they work**. Proximity plays a big role in making it easy and worthwhile for professors and staff to stop by.

This is why we typically host these events in **Herzberg Laboratories (HP 5345)**.

## 🕛 Scheduling

We usually time Coffee Socials to overlap with **lunch breaks**. This makes it easier — and more enticing — for **professors and staff** to join in and engage with students.
