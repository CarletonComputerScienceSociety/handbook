# External Game Nights

**External Game Nights** are off-campus social outings where students gather to play board games at local board game caf√©s. They offer a fun, relaxed environment to socialize, try new games, and take a break from school.

In the past, we've hosted events at venues like **The Loft Board Game Lounge** and **Level One**.

## üß© How It Works

- We **call the venue in advance** to reserve a block of seats for a specific time.
- We **create a ticket** on our Shopify store that students can purchase to claim one of the reserved seats.
- On the day of the event, we **commute as a group** to the location and spend the evening playing games and hanging out.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

### Group Dynamics & Game Selection

- Start with **quick, casual games** ‚Äî people may arrive at different times, so easier games allow for flexible group sizes and quick swaps.
- Choose **simple, easy-to-learn games** to minimize explanation time and get people playing quickly.
- Take advantage of **staff at venues like The Loft or Level One** ‚Äî they can explain rules and recommend games for your group.

### Managing Payments

- Attendees are typically responsible for their own food and drink orders.
- **Watch for walkouts** ‚Äî we've had issues in the past with students forgetting (or neglecting) to pay their tabs. If you see someone heading out, it's okay to **kindly confirm** they‚Äôve paid.

### Communication & Coordination

- Let students know the plan: where to meet, what time via our website or event poster.
- Assign someone from the exec team to arrive at the venue before the main group to confirm / setup the section we've reserved.
- Assign someone from the exec team to **keep track of tickets and headcount**, and to check in with staff at the venue upon arrival.
