## 📚 Standard Event Procedure

Running a CCSS event? Use this checklist to make sure everything runs smoothly from start to finish. This guide outlines each major step — from planning to promotion to post-event wrap-up.

### Stage 1: Submit an Event Proposal

- [ ] 🎯 Create an event name, date, time, and short description
  - Ensure the planned event date is **at least 3 weeks in advance**.
  - Confirm there are no scheduling conflicts with internal/external events.
  - If it is not intuitive what your event is based on the name, describe the logistics of your event in the proposal.
- [ ] 🎯 Designate the [Event Lead](/docs/initiatives/events/#%EF%B8%8F-the-role-of-the-event-lead).
- [ ] 🎯 Confirm budget with the **Director of Finance** if costs are involved.

📌 Once you have created your proposal, post it in the **#events Discord topic channel**.

### Stage 2: Prepare Event Materials

Once the team has confirmed you are good to proceed with your event proposal...

- [ ] 🎯 Book a room or delegate the task. Refer to the [Room Booking Guide](#) if unsure how.
- [ ] 🎯 Design the event poster or delegate the task. Refer to the [Design Guide](#) or past posters for inspiration.

📌 If you are the [Event Lead](/docs/initiatives/events/#%EF%B8%8F-the-role-of-the-event-lead), you are responsible for ensuring these steps are completed before the event can be promoted (**minimum 2 weeks** before the anticipated date).

### Stage 3: Promote The Event

- [ ] 🎯 Post to **Instagram**, **Website**, and **Discord** 2 weeks before the event.
  - Coordinate with the team to ensure it’s in the **posting schedule**.
- [ ] 🎯 Optionally post on **LinkedIn** if relevant to that platform.
- [ ] 🎯 Optionally promote to classes if relevant to that subject or demographic.

### Stage 4: Day of the Event

- [ ] 🎯 Ensure you do not leave any required equipment (cables, laptops, etc.) at home.
- [ ] 🎯 Post an **Instagram reminder** on the day of the event.
- [ ] 🎯 Arrive at least **30 minutes early** to set up.
- [ ] 🎯 Clean up the room and remove any visible garbage. Leave the space as clean as you found it.

### Stage 5: After the Event

- [ ] 🎯 Fill out the **Event Retrospective** form or share a summary with the team.
- [ ] 🎯 Create or delegate a **recap post** for Instagram or LinkedIn.

## 🧑‍✈️ The Role of the Event Lead

Every event should have **one designated Event Lead**. This person is responsible for ensuring that the event runs smoothly from start to finish.

The Event Lead doesn’t need to do everything themselves — they can delegate tasks like poster design, room booking, or social media posting.

Having a clear Event Lead prevents confusion, avoids dropped tasks, and ensures our events maintain a high standard of quality and organization.

📌 If you are proposing an event, you are **by default** the Event Lead **unless** someone else is **explicitly assigned.**
