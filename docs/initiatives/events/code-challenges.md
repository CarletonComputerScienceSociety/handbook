# Code Challenges

Our code challenge events invite students to solve problems we create and submit their answers for a chance to win a prize.

We host our challenges through a custom-built website:

## ðŸ§© How It Works

Each challenge is a short programming problem that can be solved in **any language**. Students donâ€™t submit code to be executed â€” instead, they submit the **correct final answer** based on their own implementation.

This approach lets us:

- Keep the system simple and secure (no need to run arbitrary code)
- Make the platform accessible to students of all experience levels
- Allow students to use whichever language or tools they're most comfortable with

Students who **submit a correct answer** are entered into a **random draw** to win prizes. This keeps the event friendly and encourages participation from all skill levels â€” not just the fastest coders.

# ðŸ•› Scheduling

We've traditionally run a code challenge during week of awesome that lasts the **duration of the week**, but there is no reason we couldn't run additional code challenges throughout the year that also vary in duration.

## ðŸŽ‰ History & Purpose

We started running these events during the **COVID-19 pandemic** as an easy way for students to participate in something fun and engaging online. The format worked so well that weâ€™ve continued running them even after returning to in-person events.
