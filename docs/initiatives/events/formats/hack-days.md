# Hack Days

**Hack Days** are mini-hackathons hosted by the CCSS. They’re designed to give students a focused space and dedicated time to work on projects — whether that’s something we’ve prepared in advance or something entirely self-directed.

## 🧩 What Happens at a Hack Day?

Hack Days usually follow one of two formats:

- 🛠 **Project-Focused** — We come prepared with specific projects or starter tasks for students to tackle. These might involve:

  - Open source contributions
  - Club tech projects
  - Coding challenges or tutorials

- 🎨 **Freeform** — Students show up and work on **whatever personal or group projects** they want — portfolio pieces, games, tools, etc.

No matter the format, Hack Days are about **building, learning, and collaborating** in a chill environment.

## 📌 Example: Open Source Work Day (2023–2024)

One example of a Hack Day was our [**Open Source Work Day** (Oct 21, 2023)](https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2023-2024/2023-10-21-open-source-work-day/).

- 🕙 Ran from **10:00 AM to 5:00 PM**
- 🍕 **Provided pizza** for attendees
- ✅ Organized around **two open-source projects** with pre-created issue lists
- 💬 Students worked in groups or solo and were encouraged to ask for help throughout the day

## ⚠️ Things to Consider

### Have beginner accesible options

Students do not want to waste their entire day on environment setup or struggling through a single task. Make sure you have project options that require extremely minimal setup so everyone has a good time.

### Have a plan or fallback

Even if it's a freeform day, it helps to have some starter ideas or projects in case people need inspiration.

### Make it full-day friendly

Provide **food, water, and space** to take breaks — especially if you’re running a full-day event.

### Start with a brief intro

Set expectations, introduce any projects, and make sure new students feel welcome and comfortable asking questions.

### Encourage collaboration

Hack Days are a great place to meet others and try working in teams — help facilitate that where possible.
