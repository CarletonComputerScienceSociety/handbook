# Headshot Events

**Headshot Events** are a simple but high-impact offering that help students get professional-quality photos for their LinkedIn profiles, portfolios, and resumes. They‚Äôre easy to organize and always well-received, especially by students preparing for co-op or job applications.

At these events, a **volunteer photographer** sets up in a booked room and takes headshots for any students who attend.

## üß© How It Works

- A **photographer volunteer** brings their camera, lighting, and backdrop equipment.
- We **book a room** with enough space to set up a backdrop and lights, and allow for a **line to form intuitively** near the door or hallway.
- All final photos are **uploaded to a Nextcloud folder** after the event, which is then **shared in our Discord server** so students can download their headshots.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

### Ensure White Balance & Lighting Are Properly Set

The photographer should assume that **most students will not edit their photos**.

If you're using a **white backdrop**, it's important that:

- The **white background is actually white** in the final photo ‚Äî not grey or beige.
- **Lighting is even and neutral**, with no color cast from the room or equipment.
- You perform test shots and adjustments **before attendees start arriving**.

A poorly lit or poorly balanced photo can make an otherwise great headshot unusable for students ‚Äî so taking the time to get this right is crucial.
