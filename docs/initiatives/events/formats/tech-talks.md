# Tech Talks

**Tech Talks** are presentation-style events where speakers share insights, stories, or technical deep dives on topics in computer science, software, startups, and beyond. They’re a great way to expose students to **real-world experience**, **industry perspectives**, and **cool ideas** outside of the classroom.

Tech Talks can feature **guest professionals**, **faculty**, or **students**, and they can be structured as one-off presentations or a lineup of shorter talks.

  - A single long-form talk (30–45 minutes)

## ⚠️ Things to Consider

### Shorter Talks Keep People Engaged
