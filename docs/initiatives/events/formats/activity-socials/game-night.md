# Game Nights

**Game Nights** are casual, on-campus events where students can hang out and play a variety of board games, card games, and party games. They‚Äôre a great way to relax, meet new people, and enjoy some screen-free fun.

**NOTE**: We have a seperate documentation page for **External Game Nights** ‚Äî which involve outings to places like The Loft Board Game Lounge.

## üß© Games & Setup

There are a few different ways we source games for these nights:

- **Borrowing from the MacOdrum Library** ‚Äî Carleton‚Äôs library has a board game collection available for students to borrow.
- **Club Connections** ‚Äî We‚Äôve teamed up with other campus clubs (like board game or tabletop groups) to borrow additional games.
- **Personal Collections** ‚Äî Sometimes attendees or organizers bring their own games to share.

It‚Äôs good to aim for a mix of quick, easy-to-learn games (like _Codenames_ or _Uno_) and longer strategy games (_Catan_, _Secret Hitler_, etc.) so there is something for everyone

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

Before running a Game Night, think about:

### Timing within the term

If an **External Game Night** (e.g., a Loft trip) is already planned for the same academic term, try to **space them out**. These two formats appeal to similar audiences and offer a similar vibe.

### Timing with other board game events

If other adjacent clubs are already hosting a game night, we should **avoid overlap** or schedule too closely to the existing events.

Instead, we can look for ways to **collaborate** or space out events to keep interest high and avoid event fatigue.

### Have someone capable of explaining games quickly

Many board games are complex, and it is not fun for casual attendees to spend more time learning a game then actually playing it.

### Game availability

Make sure someone is responsible for gathering and returning any borrowed games.

### Room setup

Pick a room with moveable tables and chairs so groups can form naturally.
