# Coffee Socials

**Coffee Socials** are one of the simplest and most effective events we run ‚Äî a casual gathering with free coffee, snacks, and good conversation. These events are perfect for building connections between students, staff, and faculty in a relaxed setting.

## üß© How It Works

- We set up a space on campus with **free coffee, tea, and snacks**.
- Students and staff drop by, chat, and hang out ‚Äî no speeches or presentations required.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

### Location

- **Proximity matters**: If you're hoping for professors or staff to attend, host the event **close to where they work**.
- We typically use **Herzberg Laboratories (HP 5345)** because it‚Äôs near most faculty offices and familiar to CS students.

### Scheduling

- **Overlap with staff lunch breaks** ‚Äî this makes it much easier for staff and faculty to casually attend without rearranging their schedules.
- Avoid peak class times so that students are more likely to drop by.

### Room Setup

- If no effort is made, students will crowd around the entrance of small spaces like HP 5345. Consider setting up the tables in such a way it encourages students to go further into the room.
