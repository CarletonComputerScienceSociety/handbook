# Prof Night

**Prof Night** is a social event where students and professors can connect outside the classroom in a relaxed, informal setting. It‚Äôs one of the best ways to **build community** between students and faculty and encourage open conversation.

We‚Äôve hosted Prof Night at **Mike‚Äôs Place** and **Ollie‚Äôs Pub** ‚Äî both located in Carleton‚Äôs University Centre (UC).

## üß© What It Is

- A **casual evening event** where students and profs gather for food, drinks, and conversation.
- We usually provide attendees with a (non alcoholic) Free drink ticket

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

### Survey Profs for Best Date

- Profs have busy and varied schedules. Send out a **Doodle poll or short survey** to gather availability before booking a date.
- Avoid midterm season or major deadlines.

### Promote at the SCS Meeting

- Announce the event at the **School of Computer Science meeting** to get buy-in and spread the word internally.
- Profs are more likely to attend when they know other colleagues are going too.

### Email Reminder to Profs

- A few days before the event, send a **short reminder email** to all invited faculty.
- Include:
  - Time & location
  - Encouragement to drop by even if only for part of the night
