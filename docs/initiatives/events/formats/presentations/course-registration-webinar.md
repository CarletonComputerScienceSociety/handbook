# Course Registration Webinar

The Course Registration Webinar is a live online presentation designed to help first-year CS students understand **how to build their first timetable** and **register for courses** at Carleton.

We typically run this event in **late June**, just before **first-year registration opens**.

## 🧩 What It Is

- A **live webinar presentation** (usually hosted over Zoom) focused on helping new students understand:
  - Degree requirements
  - Carleton Central registration system
  - Course planning tips and common mistakes
- Ends with a **student panel** of upper-years sharing advice, experiences, and answering live questions
- Often followed up by [**Course Registration Office Hours**](../course-registration-office-hours) for more personalized help

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters

This event is **one of the earliest touchpoints** we have with incoming students — and it’s mutually beneficial:

- **For students:** It reduces stress, provides clarity, and offers real-world advice from people who’ve already been through the process.
- **For CCSS:** It brings new students into our Discord server and shows them early on that we’re a helpful, welcoming part of the CS experience at Carleton.

## ⚠️ Things to Consider

### SCS Content Approval

- The school of computer science often requests to few the slide content for this presentation

### Include a Diverse Panel

- Always include a **panel of students from varying years** — first-years who recently registered, upper-years who have seen the full degree, and maybe even someone with co-op or elective advice.

### Promote Early

- Highschool students **DO NOT regularly check their Carleton email&**, so early promotion is essential to hit the greatest number of attendees.
