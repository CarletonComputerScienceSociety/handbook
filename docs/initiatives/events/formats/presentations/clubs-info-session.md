# Club Info Sessions

**Club Info Sessions** are events where we showcase the many **adjacent tech-focused clubs** at Carleton. The goal is to introduce students to the broader CS/tech student community and help them find opportunities to get involved outside of class.

These events are especially useful for **new students**, and are often run at the **start of the Fall or Winter terms**.

## üß© What They Are

The event typically follows this format:

- Each participating club gets **5‚Äì10 minutes** to present what they do
- Presentations run **back-to-back**, usually in a lecture hall or large classroom
- The session ends with a **Coffee Social‚Äìstyle mixer**, where students can ask questions, chat with club reps, and grab snacks

This format keeps things informative and high-energy, followed by an open space for casual interaction.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

### Club Participation is Key

- The success of this event depends heavily on **how many clubs are active** and willing to participate.
- In years with **fewer clubs**, it may not make sense to run this as a standalone event.

### Varying Levels of Organization

- Some clubs may not be as responsive or organized ‚Äî **follow up early and often** to confirm participation.
- Be prepared for **last-minute dropouts or missing materials**, especially if the event is tied to orientation deadlines or requires poster assets.
