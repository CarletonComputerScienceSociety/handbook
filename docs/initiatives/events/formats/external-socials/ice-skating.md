# Ice Skating

**Ice Skating** is a fun, seasonal social event that takes advantage of Ottawa’s amazing outdoor rinks. It’s casual, low-cost, and a great way for students to enjoy winter together — especially for those new to the city or country.

We’ve run this event at both the **Rideau Canal** and the **Rink of Dreams** outside **Ottawa City Hall**.

## 🧩 What It Is

- A **drop-in style outdoor skating event**, where students can bring their own skates or rent a pair at the rink.
- Typically run in **January or February**, when rinks are reliably open and the weather is manageable.

## ⚠️ Things to Consider

### Ice Conditions & Open Status

- The **Canal opens and closes based on weather**, so always check the NCC website before committing.
- The **Rink of Dreams** is more reliable and often has machine-maintained ice even in mild weather.

### Skate Rentals

- Not all students will have their own skates — be sure to:
  - **Mention nearby rental options** in your promo materials
  - Include pricing and ID requirements (if applicable)

### Meeting Spot

- Pick a clear meeting point — these public rinks can get busy and spread out
- Consider posting a **Discord message** when you arrive so students can find the group
