# Laser Tag

**Laser Tag** is one of our most active and high-energy event formats. It‚Äôs a great way for students to blow off steam, compete in teams, and bond in a fun, off-campus environment.

We typically host this event at **LaserMaxx Ottawa**, a local laser tag venue with a large arena and great group rates.

## üß© How It Works

- We **call LaserMaxx in advance** to reserve a block of game slots for our group.
- We **create a ticket** on our Shopify store so students can buy in and reserve a spot.

Depending on group size and venue availability, we may split into multiple teams or rotate rounds.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

### Booking & Communication

- Reserve **well in advance** ‚Äî LaserMaxx can fill up quickly during evenings and weekends.
- Communicate clearly about **meeting points, what to bring**, and what‚Äôs included with the ticket (e.g., how many games, whether snacks/drinks are available at the venue).

### Arrival & Coordination

- Arrive early to check in, collect waivers if needed, and get organized before game time.
- Designate someone to **track ticket holders**, confirm attendance, and act as the main point of contact with the venue.
