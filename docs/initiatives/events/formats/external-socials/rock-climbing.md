# Rock Climbing

**Rock Climbing Nights** are an active and engaging way to get students off campus and moving. These events provide a great change of pace from typical social events ‚Äî especially for students looking to try something new or stay active.

We typically host this event at **Coyote Rock Gym**, a local climbing facility with gear rentals and routes for all skill levels.

## üß© How It Works

- We **call the gym in advance** to reserve space for our group.
- We **create a ticket** on our Shopify store so students can reserve their spot and pre-pay for admission.
- On the day of the event, we **commute together** to the gym and climb in groups.

Coyote Rock Gym provides **rental gear** and an intro briefing for new climbers, so no experience is required.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

### Timing the Event

- Coyote is **a bit difficult to access by transit**, so we‚Äôve traditionally hosted this event during **Reading Week** or lighter parts of the semester when students are more flexible.
- That said, there‚Äôs **no reason it can‚Äôt be run during the semester** ‚Äî just plan ahead and offer clear directions or a carpool option.

### Ticketing & Attendance

- Make sure the **ticket covers the climbing fee and any rental gear** (usually shoes and harness).
- Communicate **what‚Äôs included** in the ticket and **what students need to bring** (e.g., athletic wear, water bottle).

### Group Management

- Plan for **group size limits** ‚Äî climbing gyms have occupancy limits, so confirm your maximum group size with the venue. In past years, we typically can only have 15 or less people in our group.
  - To get around this size limit, we usually just let already experienced students who do not need the tutorial come in and act as a seperate group
- Have one exec or event lead ready to **coordinate check-in** and guide the group through the process.

### Support for New Climbers

- It helps to have a few **experienced climbers** in the group who can give **tips, encouragement, or ba**
