# Role of Event Leads

Every event should have **one designated Event Lead**. This person is responsible for ensuring that the event runs smoothly from start to finish.

The Event Lead doesn’t need to do everything themselves — they can delegate tasks like poster design, room booking, or social media posting.

Having a clear Event Lead prevents confusion, avoids dropped tasks, and ensures our events maintain a high standard of quality and organization.

If you are proposing an event, you are **by default** the Event Lead **unless** someone else is **explicitly assigned.**
