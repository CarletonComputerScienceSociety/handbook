# CS & Society Lecture

The CS & Society Lecture is an annual event hosted by the Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS) in collaboration with the **School of Computer Science (SCS)**. The goal of this lecture is to explore the broader impact of computing on society.

## 🤝 Finding Speakers

This event is made possible through ongoing support from the School of Computer Science. In particular, **Michel Barbeau**, Director of SCS, has regularly helped identify and recommend potential guest speakers for the lecture.

## 🕛 Scheduling

It has typically taken place during the **winter term**, though there’s no strict requirement for when it needs to happen — the timing is flexible based on availability and planning. We’ve been running this event **annually since the 2020–2021 academic year**.
