# Overview

The Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS) does a lot. From running events to maintaining helpful resources and offering valuable services to our student community — we're constantly working on initiatives that make student life in the CS department better.

The word **"initiative"** is how we group everything we do. Almost everything we take on falls into one of three main categories:

## [🎉 Events](/docs/initiatives/events/)

These are the most visible part of what we do. CCSS events are how we help build community, connect students with opportunities, and make university life a bit more fun (or useful). Some examples include:

- **Tech Talks** — Hear from industry professionals and researchers on cool topics.
- **Coffee Socials** — A chill way to meet other students and unwind.
- **Hackathons** — Collaborative coding competitions with prizes, food, and learning.
- **End-of-Year BBQ** — Celebrate the end of the term with food and friends.

## [📝 Publications](/docs/initiatives/publications/)

We produce content that helps students succeed and showcases the community around them. Some examples include:

- **FAQs & Guides** — Articles that answer common questions about the CS program, courses, co-op, and more.
- **Student Spotlights** — Articles and social media posts that highlight cool projects, experiences, and achievements from our student body.

## [🛠️ Services](/docs/initiatives/services/)

Beyond events and resources, we run some low-key but highly valuable services that students rely on. Some examples include:

- **The Lounge Canteen** — Grab a snack, a drink, or just hang out in the CCSS Lounge.
- **Questions Repository** — A growing collection of past midterms, finals, and assignments to help you study smarter.
