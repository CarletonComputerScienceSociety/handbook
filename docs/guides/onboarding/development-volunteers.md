# Development Volunteer Onboarding

Welcome to the CCSS Development Team! We're excited to have you contribute to building tools and resources that support the Carleton Computer Science community.

This guide will walk you through how to get started, what to expect, and how to stay connected.

## 🚀 Onboarding Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Join the CCSS Internal Discord

You should have received an **invite link** in your welcome email. Join the server and **ping `@mathyoumb`** with your GitHub username.

This is so we can:

- Add you to the CCSS GitHub organization
- Give you the `development-volunteer` role in Discord

#### 💬 **Why Discord?**

The CCSS internal Discord is where we:

- Answer development questions
- Post async updates
- Share announcements
- Schedule optional development sync calls

You can view all scheduled calls in the Discord event list.

### 📅 Step 2: Schedule Your Onboarding Call

You can schedule on onboardin call by reaching out in **Discord DMs** with **`@mathyoumb`** **or use this link** to schedule a quick onboarding chat: **👉 [Book a call](https://calendly.com/matthewmacraebovell/chats)**

In this call, we'll:

- Learn about your goals
- Walk through the project landscape
- Match you with an issue aligned to your interests and CCSS priorities

### 💻 Step 3 (Bonus): Check Out the GitHub & Issues Board

Take some time to explore:

- 📂 [CCSS GitHub Organization](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety)
- 🔧 [Development Projects Board](https://github.com/orgs/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/projects/24)

You’ll find open issues, ongoing initiatives, and useful project documentation.

## 🧭 How This Is Going to Work

### 📌 Picking Up Work

- New issues will be added to the GitHub board on a **rolling basis** by **`@mathyoumb`**.
- When you're ready to work on something, you can:
  - **Self-assign an issue**, or
  - **[Book a call](https://calendly.com/matthewmacraebovell/chats) with Matthew** for tailored suggestions

### 🤝 Support While You Work

- Ask questions anytime in `#development` in the internal Discord.
- You can also schedule a **[1:1 call](https://calendly.com/matthewmacraebovell/chats)** with Matthew anytime\*\* for support (with 24 hours' notice, pending availability).

### 🗒️ Progress Updates

- If you’ve been assigned an issue for **over a week**, please post a short async update in Discord to let us know:
  - What’s done
  - What’s in progress
  - Where you might be stuck

If **`@mathyoumb`** hasn't heard from you in **over a week**, they will reach out to check in, if you do not respond withing 48 hours, they will **unassign** you from the issue.

### 🧑‍💻 Optional Sync Calls

- Dev sync calls will be scheduled **ad hoc** in Discord.
- Attendance is optional — not everyone needs to join, and timing may not work for all time zones.

### 📢 Staying Up to Date

- All updates regarding **meetings** and **volunteer opportunities** will be posted in Discord in the following channels:
  - `#announcements`
  - `#development`
